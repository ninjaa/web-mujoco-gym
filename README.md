# 🚀 MuJoCo WebSim: Massively Parallel RL in Your Browser

## 🎯 The Vision

**"What if you could run 1000 reinforcement learning environments on your laptop... in a browser tab?"**

MuJoCo WebSim brings massively parallel physics simulation to the web, democratizing large-scale RL experimentation. No cloud setup. No infrastructure costs. Just open a browser and start training.

## 💡 Why This Matters

Current RL research requires either:
- 🖥️ Expensive cloud compute for parallel training
- ⏰ Slow local training with limited parallelism  
- 🔧 Complex distributed systems setup

**We're changing that.** With WebAssembly and Web Workers, we can run hundreds of MuJoCo physics simulations in parallel, right in your browser.

### Key Innovations
1. **Browser-Native Parallelism**: Leverage Web Workers for true parallel execution
2. **Zero Infrastructure**: No Docker swarms, no Kubernetes, no cloud bills
3. **Real-Time Visualization**: See what your agent is learning as it trains
4. **Instant Sharing**: Send a URL to share your trained agent with anyone
5. **Cross-Platform**: Works on any device with a modern browser

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Working
- MuJoCo WASM compilation pipeline (x86_64 via Docker on Apple Silicon)
- Multi-environment orchestration with Web Workers
- Real-time visualization dashboard
- Basic physics simulation (pendulum demo)

### 🚧 In Progress
- Integration of complex robot models (humanoid, ant, cheetah)
- Performance optimization for 1000+ environments
- RL policy integration
- Environment randomization

### 📈 Performance Targets
- **Current**: 120 visual FPS with 12 environments
- **Target**: 1000+ environments at 10,000+ physics steps/second
- **Strategy**: Decouple physics from rendering, batch updates

## 🎮 Use Cases

1. **RL Education**: Students can experiment without cloud access
2. **Rapid Prototyping**: Test reward functions and environment designs instantly
3. **Interactive Demos**: Show off your trained agents with a shareable link
4. **Curriculum Learning**: Dynamically adjust environment difficulty
5. **Multi-Agent RL**: Run swarms of agents in the same browser
