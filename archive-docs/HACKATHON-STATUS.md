# MuJoCo WASM Parallel RL - Hackathon Status

## 🎯 Project Vision
Build a massively parallel MuJoCo simulation environment running in the browser via WASM, enabling:
- 1000+ parallel RL environments on a single machine
- Browser-based architecture avoiding Docker container overhead
- Scalable from local Mac to cloud deployment
- Real-time visualization and monitoring

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Docker/WASM Build Pipeline**
   - x86_64 Docker container successfully builds MuJoCo WASM on Apple Silicon
   - Nginx serves WASM files with proper CORS headers
   - Build artifacts persist across container restarts

2. **multi-env-demo.html** (Mock Physics)
   - Successfully initializes and runs multiple parallel environments
   - Clean UI with dark theme and performance metrics
   - Shows proof-of-concept for parallel execution
   - **Issue**: Shows floating balls instead of proper robot models
   - **Issue**: Missing environment-generator.js (404 error)

3. **mujoco-simple-test.html** (Real MuJoCo)
   - Successfully loads actual MuJoCo WASM
   - Creates and renders a simple pendulum simulation
   - **Issue**: Step function has undefined variable error

### ❌ What's Not Working
1. **mujoco-parallel-test.html**
   - Completely broken - initialization fails
   - Likely due to Web Worker + COEP issues

2. **Performance Gap**
   - Current: ~120 FPS with mock physics
   - Industry standard: Millions of steps/second
   - Need to understand the bottleneck

### 🤔 Key Questions to Answer
1. **Performance**: Why only 120 FPS vs millions?
   - Is it rendering overhead?
   - JavaScript vs native performance?
   - Browser limitations?

2. **Scaling**: What's the real limit?
   - How many envs can we run on M1 Mac?
   - How many on cloud GPU instance?
   - Memory vs CPU bottleneck?

3. **Use Cases**: What RL problems does this solve?
   - Training vs inference
   - Distributed vs single-machine
   - Real-time vs batch processing

## 🎪 Hackathon Goals (Proposed)

### Tier 1: Core Demo (Must Have)
1. Fix multi-env-demo to show actual robot models (humanoid, ant, etc.)
2. Get at least one page working with real MuJoCo physics
3. Benchmark: Find max parallel envs on local machine
4. Create compelling visual demo showing 100+ envs

### Tier 2: Performance & Scale (Should Have)  
1. Profile and optimize to reach 1000+ FPS
2. Add environment diversity (randomized terrains, obstacles)
3. Simple RL policy integration (even if just random actions)
4. Cloud deployment test with performance comparison

### Tier 3: Innovation (Nice to Have)
1. Prompt-based environment generation
2. Real-time policy switching
3. Multi-agent scenarios
4. Export training data for offline RL

## 🔧 Technical Architecture
```
Browser (Main Thread)
    ├── Orchestrator (manages worker pool)
    ├── Visualization (canvas rendering)
    └── UI Controls
    
Web Workers (parallel threads)
    ├── Worker 1: Envs 0-19
    ├── Worker 2: Envs 20-39
    └── ... (50 workers total)
    
Each Worker:
    ├── MuJoCo WASM instance
    ├── Multiple environment states
    └── Physics stepping loop
```

## 📈 Performance Analysis
- **Current Bottleneck**: Likely rendering + main thread coordination
- **Optimization Paths**:
  1. Batch updates from workers
  2. Reduce rendering frequency
  3. Use OffscreenCanvas in workers
  4. WebGL for visualization

## 🚀 Next Steps Priority
1. Fix immediate bugs to get basic demo working
2. Benchmark current performance properly
3. Choose specific RL use case to showcase
4. Polish demo for presentation

## 💡 Unique Value Proposition
"Run 1000 RL environments in your browser - no cloud needed"
- Democratizes large-scale RL experimentation
- Zero infrastructure setup
- Real-time visualization built-in
- Perfect for education, research, and rapid prototyping
