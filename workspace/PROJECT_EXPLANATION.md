## üß† **The Science: Is This Real Learning?**

### **YES - This is Real Reinforcement Learning with Transfer Potential**

**Physics Foundation:**
- Uses **MuJoCo** (Multi-Joint dynamics with Contact) - the same physics engine used in OpenAI Gym, DeepMind, and most RL research
- **17 actuated joints** controlling hip, knee, ankle, shoulder, elbow movements
- **Real contact dynamics** with ground, friction, joint limits, and momentum conservation
- **376-dimensional observation space** including joint positions, velocities, center of mass, contact forces

**Model Architecture:**
- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** - state-of-the-art policy gradient method
- **Actor-Critic** with 2-layer MLPs (64 hidden units each)
- **Continuous action space** (-1 to +1 for each joint torque)
- **Trained for ~1M timesteps** on Humanoid-v4 environment

**Transfer Learning Potential:**
- ‚úÖ **Sim-to-Real**: MuJoCo models can transfer to real robots (with domain adaptation)
- ‚úÖ **Policy Export**: The learned policy can be exported to other MuJoCo environments
- ‚úÖ **Fine-tuning**: Can be further trained on new tasks or environments
- ‚úÖ **Analysis**: Full access to internal states, gradients, and decision process
